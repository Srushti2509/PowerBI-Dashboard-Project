# PowerBI-Dashboard-Project
# Sales and Order Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sales and order data using Power BI to derive meaningful insights and address key business questions. The dataset consists of Orders.csv and Details.csv, which contain order and product details. Using this data, an interactive and visually compelling dashboard was created in Power BI to provide a deeper understanding of sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends.


## Dataset Description
The datasets provided include:

Orders.csv: Contains information on orders, including order IDs, customer IDs, order dates, and total sales.

Details.csv: Includes detailed product information for each order, such as product IDs, quantities sold, and unit prices.
